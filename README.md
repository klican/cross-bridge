# Modelling of cardiac cross-bridge cycling during ischemia


We propose a cardiac myofilament model, which comprises ischemia as
pathological process affecting the force of contraction. As ischemia tightly
relates with mitochondrial dysfunction, we are focusing on additional
mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction, which we incorporated into the model
of cross-bridge kinetics that was developed by others.

Cardiac myofilament model comprises from two fundamental mechanisms, which are
mutually interconnected. First is the cross-bridge cycle, which denotes the
process of contraction of troponin-tropomyosin complex by Ca2+, which secondly
initiates the cross-bridge cycle. The model reproduces the force of contraction
under various concentrations of Ca2+ and metabolites of ATP. The changing level
of metabolites and pH during ischemia, for example the phosphates and ADP, are
collectively affecting the contraction in individual phases of cross-bridge
cycle. Experimental models show biphasic response of ADP on the force of
contraction depending on the concentrations of the rest of metabolites and ATP.
Ischemia also causes acidosis and increase of phosphate level in intracellular
environment, both strongly participating in weakening of the force of
contraction of heart muscle.

We enriched existing model with additional
parameters validating the environment of mitochondrial dysfunction, thus
enabling the expanded contemporary model of ischemia to provide new insights on
the subject.

Our model uses the mean-field approximations implemented as set of ODEs. We exported
and further revised the model from CellML into the Python programming language. The
numerical analysis was performed using VODE integrator with BDF method from the Python
SciPy package.
